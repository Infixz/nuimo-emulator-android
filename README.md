# Nuimo Emulator for Android

The Nuimo emulator for Android can be used as a replacement for a physical Nuimo device.

<a href="https://github.com/getsenic/nuimo-emulator-ios/">Looking for a Nuimo emulator for your iOS device?</a>

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio (requires Android Studio 2.0 beta 2+)
3. Install the emulator app on your Android device (requires Android 5.0+)
4. Enable bluetooth to start advertising and allow for connections before you start the app

Alternatively you can <a href="https://senic.com/developers">download and install the emulator app directly to your phone</a>.

## Notes

- Not all Android devices support the emulator mode (advertising in peripheral mode). In that case the emulator app will let you know.
- Even after stopping the app, your Android device will still be discovered as a Nuimo device. But you won't be able to connect. Simply restart your Android's bluetooth.
